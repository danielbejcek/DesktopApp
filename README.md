# Inventory

# Export
  After a client places an order directed to the SaniArt company, user now has to option the create a contract template from within the App.
This template provides of all the necessary details regarding the job order, for example: Name of the order, material required, contract number etc...
But most importantly, user can now select all of the components required for the job and asign them with specific amount. 
After the template meets the user's needs and all of the data has been filled out, a PDF file is then created which contains all the necessary information.
User can now properly track the movement of components thanks to the final step of the screen, which is the automatic deduction of the selected components from the warehouse's inventory.

# Import
  User also works with an outside application that provides a certain number of PDF files which contain outline maps. 
In the final screen user can merge these PDF files aswell as the PDF file that was created in the previous screen. 
This creates a final job contract template bound to be delivered to the workshop, where employees manufacture specific parts according to the outline maps and implement them with correct components.

# TL;DR
Creation of this App took me roughly around 3 months, I'm happy to finally deliver a product that not only gave me plenty of opportunities to learn and increase my skill as a programmer, but also a product that helps automate work and make life of some people tiny bit easier.
